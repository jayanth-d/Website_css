                    <h3>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton</h3>
                    <p class="hamBio"> Is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Mercedes.<br>
                        In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles, 
                        and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (103), and podium finishes (191), among others.<br>
                        Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998.<br> 
                        This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first, 
                        and so far only, black driver to race in the series. <br>
                        In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. <br>
                        The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake 
                        on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. <br>
                        After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.<br>
                        Changes to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton,
                        during which he has won six further drivers' titles. <br>
                        Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. <br>
                        Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, 
                        in which Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. <br>
                        His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.<br>

                    <h3>Sebastian Vettel</h3>
                    <p class="sebBio"> Is a German racing driver who competed in Formula One from 2007 to 2022 for BMW Sauber, Toro Rosso, Red Bull, Ferrari, and Aston Martin.<br> 
                        Vettel is one of the most successful drivers in Formula One history and has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, 
                        which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. Vettel holds the record for being the youngest World Champion in Formula One.<br> 
                        He also has the third-most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122), and fourth-most pole positions (57).<br>
                        Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in 2007.<br> 
                        As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008.<br> 
                        Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, 
                        the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the record for the most consecutive race wins with nine.<br>
                        Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018,
                        although he finished both years as runner-up. <br>
                        He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, 
                        before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.<br>

                        and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. <br>
                        He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.<br>
                        The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, he was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. <br>
                        Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion, 
                        Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; 
                        he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, 
                        and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, 
                        the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002.<br>

                        Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.<br>
                        James has won four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, three All-Star MVP awards,

                        winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010 and leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007.<br> 
                        After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; 
                        this was announced in the television special The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.<br>

                    <h3>Rafael Nadal Parera</h3>
                    <p class="nadalBio">is a Spanish professional tennis player. He is currently ranked world No. 2 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).<br>
                        He has been ranked world No. 1 for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. <br>
                        Nadal has won an all-time record 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, 
                        including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.<br>
                        His 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.<br>
                        For over a decade, Nadal has dominated men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three, 
                        collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis players of all time.<br>
                        At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, 
                        reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. <br>
                        Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. <br>
                        He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, 
                        then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, 
                        and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam).<br>

                        Federer's 20 Grand Slam singles titles also put him at third most of all time, only behind Djokovic with 21 and record holder Nadal with 22,
